### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jithin, an independent application developer and founder of MountZoft Labs. My journey began in 2017 during college when I published my first app, Fun with Words. After four years at two startups, I developed several apps, including Game Of Zeros, Predict Gender(with TensorFlow), Promise Box, and Personality Test with Images. Now, Iâ€™m focused on Habit Card, a habit tracker that emphasizes habit health, helping users build lasting habits with simplicity and meaningful progress.
