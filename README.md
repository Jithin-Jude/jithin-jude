### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jithin, an independent application developer and founder of MountZoft Labs. My journey began in 2017 during college when I published my first app, Fun with Words. After four years at two startups, I developed several apps, including Game Of Zeros, Predict Gender(with TensorFlow), Promise Box, and Personality Test with Images. Now, Iâ€™m focused on Habit Card, a habit tracker that emphasizes habit health, helping users build lasting habits with simplicity and meaningful progress.

## How I came up with Habit Card

[ Small Habits, Big Changes â€” Start Today!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=habit.tracker.habitcard)

Iâ€™ve tried many habit trackers to manage my daily routines, but none completely satisfied my requirements. I wanted a tracker that combined a GitHub-style contribution graph with the ability to mark habits as completed directly from notifications and a home screen widget for seamless tracking.

Although some trackers with GitHub-inspired designs exist, they lack the seamless integration with notifications and widgets that I envisioned. So I build one for me: Habit Card.

## Why does Habit Card stand out?

- **Focus and Simplicity**: Habit Card offer a straightforward, intuitive approach to help you start and stick to the habits you care about.The design makes it easier for users to focus on one habit at a time, reducing cognitive overload.

- **Creator-Friendly Design**: Inspired by GitHubâ€™s heatmap design, Habit Card caters especially to creators and entrepreneurs.

- **Habit Health**: The app prioritizes habit health. Users can track their habits at their own pace while maintaining a clear visual understanding of their progress.

- **Lightweight and Privacy-Focused**: The app is under 4MB and gives you the option to turn off analytics.
